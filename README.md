<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

This is a Java 2D multiplayer game that uses sockets to play Whack-A-Mole.
<br />
It is a client/server game, divided into two separate projects, one for the game server and one for the game client.
<br />
Click here to view the [demo](https://youtu.be/1wNsiModf5E).

With this game, you can
* play the stand-alone version
* Play the two-person version with friends
* choose to play the role of whacking or releasing moles in the two-person version.
 The method of determining whether to win or lose is to compare the number of moles captured with the number of moles that were successfully released but not captured.

Of course, since your needs may be different, you are very welcome to suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue!
